# Python-Project
Programming language can be a key in your hand for your perfect dream job in the software 
industry. In todayâ€™s market, Python has been declared as the most used and most demanding 
programming language of all. As the language is getting dominant in all major fields: Ranging 
from software development to machine learning and data analytics. It also explains how to 
implement the various object-oriented concepts. Our implementation avoids these performance 
problems. It is also easily readable and maintainable across a wide chain of developers. It is so 
because it has kicked one step higher to the programming paradigm. The code which is written 
resembles plain English and can be understood even by beginner programmers. It also helps to 
update the code easily from time to time and invest less effort in doing so. First-class 
procedures and iterators would also be valuable extensions to the language. We study the 
various concepts of Python and performed various practicals. It provides good and impactful 
concepts in programming languages.
